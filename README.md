# DiscreteMath
A bunch of Java code written as Math projects

Take a look at the code, and feel free to clone and compile on your machine.
I used eclipse which generated project files, but I used the gitignore to keep the repo clean.
If you for some reason can't compile, or don't want to, head over to the releases page to find binaries that execute Main.java.
